Nick Bromer resides in his pleasant Pennsylvania farmhouse with his wife, and occasionally his vagrant son.  In his spare time he enjoys reading about history, playing the blues at his local watering hole, spending quality time with his cat Artemis, and talking relentlessly about theoretical physics to anyone who will listen.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
He is extremely passionate about creating new technologies that will make a lasting difference in the world. He enjoys all intellectual pursuits, but is especially fond of coming up with new product ideas and using technology to solve problems.
